<h1><a name="Installing_the_mvGenTL_Acquire_Remo"> Installing the mvGenTL-Acquire Driver </a></h1>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="Introduction"> Introduction </a></h2>
<p>
To use a GenICam/GenTL compliant camera (grab images from it and change its
settings), a driver is needed, consisting of a few libraries and a
dozen or so configuration files. These files are <em>run time</em> required.
</p><p>
To develop applications that can use a GenICam/GenTL compliant camera, a source
tree is needed, containing header files, makefiles, samples, and a few
libraries. These files are <em>compile time</em> required.
</p><p>
Both file collections are distributed in a single package : <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-x86-n.n.n.n.tgz</code>.
</p><p>
To install this package, a shell script must be run : <code>install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh</code>.<br>
You may need to enable the execute flag with <code>chmod a+x install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh</code>.<br>
</p><p>
This document describes what this script does and how it should be invoked.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Invoking_the_Installation_Script"> Invoking the Installation Script </a></h2>
<p>
The installation script (<code>install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh</code>) and the archive (<code>mvGenTL_Acquire-x86-n.n.n.n.tgz</code>) <em>must</em> reside in the same directory.<br>
Nothing is written to this directory during script execution, so no
write access to the directory is needed in order to execute the script.
It could even be executed from a partition that was mounted read-only
(e.g. from a CD-ROM).
</p><p>
You should run the script as a <em>normal user</em>, and will be asked for the <em>superuser</em> password when needed (unless you did a <code>sudo</code> shortly before invoking the script).
</p><p>
The script takes two arguments, both of which are optional:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> target directory name
</li>
<li> version
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The arguments must be specified in this order.<br>
Invoke with argument <code>-h</code> to see a help message.
</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="Target_Directory_Name"> Target Directory Name </a></h3>
<p>
The target directory name specifies where to place the driver.<br>
If the directory does not yet exist, it will be created.<br>
The path can be either absolute or relative; i.e. the name may but need not start with <code><b>/</b></code>.<br>
Write access to this directory, or the directory above, is not needed, as the archive will be unpacked using <code>sudo</code>.<br>
It is therefore ok to specify e.g. <code><b>/usr/local</b></code>.
</p><p>
</p><div style="border: 1px dashed rgb(0, 82, 136); padding: 5px;"> This directory is only used for the files that are <em>run time</em> required.</div>
<p>
The files required at <em>compile time</em> are always installed in <code><b>$HOME/mvimpact-acquire-x86-n.n.n.n</b></code>.<br>
The script also creates a convenient softlink to this directory:
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    mvimpact-acquire -&gt; mvimpact_acquire-x86-1.10.30.108
</pre></div>
Use <code><b>$HOME/mvimpact-acquire</b></code> in all your scripts and makefiles, and nothing needs to be changed after an update.
<p>
If this argument is not specified, or is <code><b>.</b></code>, the driver will be placed in the current working directory.
</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="Version"> Version </a></h3>
<p>
The version argument is entirely optional.<br>
If no version is specified, the most recent <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-n.n.n.n.tgz</code> found in the current directory will be installed.<br>
Often there will be only one <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-n.n.n.n.tgz</code> file in that directory. It is then pointless to specify a version.
</p><p>
A note on terminology. Suppose the archive file is called <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-1.10.30.108.tgz</code>. The driver in this archive will have <em>major version</em> number <code><b>1</b></code>, <em>minor version</em> number <code><b>10</b></code>, <em>build</em> number <code><b>30</b></code> and <em>release</em> number <code><b>108</b></code>.
</p><p>
Now suppose that <code>install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh</code> resides in <code><b>/tmp</b></code> (as will often be the case), and that <code><b>/tmp</b></code> also contains <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-1.10.30.108.tgz</code> and <code>mvGenTL_Acquire-1.10.28.102.tgz</code>. Then both
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    ./install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh  $HOME/mvGTLA  1.10.30.108
</pre></div>
and
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    ./install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh  $HOME/mvGTLA
</pre></div>
will install version <code>1.10.30.108</code> in directory <code>$HOME/mvGTLA</code>, as that is the most recent version.<br>
To install version <code>1.10.28.102</code>, you must be explicit:
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    ./install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh  $HOME/mvGTLA  1.10.28.102
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="What_the_Script_Does"> What the Script Does </a></h2>
<p>The script not only copies files to their respective target
directories, but also patches a few config files.
</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="Prerequisites"> Prerequisites </a></h3>
<p>
The mvGenTL-Acquire driver implements the GenICam&#8482; standard.<br>
As such, it rests on a handful of GenICam&#8482; libraries, which the
installer will also install.
</p><p>
Not automatically installed is the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/"
target="_top" class="el">wxWidgets</a> development package.<br>
Its manual installation <b>prior to running the install script</b>, though not strictly required, is strongly
recommended, as without it, <code>wxPropView</code> cannot be built.<br>
On SuSE, the package is called <code>wxGTK-devel</code>, on Ubuntu <code>libwxgtk3.0-dev</code>.
</p><h3><a name="Dynamic_Linking"> Dynamic Linking </a></h3>
<p>
The driver consists of a number of shared libraries.<br>
Where on the hard disk these libraries will end up depends on the first argument passed to the install script.<br>
Suppose the script was called like so:
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    ./install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh  /usr/local
</pre></div>
The libraries will then be installed in
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    /usr/local/lib
    /usr/local/lib/genapi/generic
    $HOME/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86
</pre></div>
This is relevant to <code>ld</code> at <em>compile time</em>, and to <code>ld.so</code> at <em>run time</em>.
<p>
So that <code>ld</code> can find <code>libmvDeviceManager.so</code> at compile time, add a line like this to your makefile:
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    LDFLAGS+=-L$(HOME)/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86 -lmvDeviceManager
</pre></div>
<p>
So that <code>ld.so</code> can find all the required libs at run time, the script writes
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    $GENICAM_ROOT/lib
    $GENICAM_ROOT/lib/genapi/generic
    $HOME/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86
</pre></div>
to either <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/genicam.conf</code> and <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/acquire.conf</code> or <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>, expanding the environment variables in the process.<br>
On systems where <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> sources all files found in directory <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> (like Ubuntu and SuSE), the pathes are written to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/genicam.conf</code> and <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/acquire.conf</code>.<br>
Else, they are written to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>.<br>
The script then adds the libraries to the <code>ld.so</code> cache by calling <code>ldconfig</code>.<br>Obviously
all of this is done as superuser, but that will go by unnoticed, as the
superuser password was already requested earlier in the script, when
installing the prerequisites.
<p>
</p><div style="border: 1px dashed rgb(0, 82, 136); padding: 5px;"> If you ever need to edit <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/genicam.conf</code> by hand, you must write out the pathes in full, and not include any environment variables. So you should write e.g.
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    /usr/local/lib
    /usr/local/lib/genapi/generic
    /home/john/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86
</pre></div>
rather than
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    $GENICAM_ROOT/lib
    $GENICAM_ROOT/lib/genapi/generic
    $HOME/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86
</pre></div>
(where <code>/usr/local</code> and <code>/home/john</code> are obviously just examples).
<p>
This is so because <code>ldconfig</code> does not expand environment variables when reading the configuration files.
</p></div><p>
</p><h3><a name="Environment_Variables"> Environment Variables </a></h3>
<p>
The GenICam&#8482; libraries expect to find three environment variables.<br>
The install script will write the corresponding <code>export</code> commands
to either <code>/etc/profile.d/genicam.sh</code> or <code>/etc/profile</code>.<br>
On systems where <code>/etc/profile</code> sources all files found in directory <code>/etc/profile.d/*.sh</code> (like Ubuntu and SuSE), the <code>export</code> commands are written to <code>/etc/profile.d/genicam.sh</code>.<br>
Else, they are written to <code>/etc/profile</code>.
</p><p>
In addition, an <code>export</code> line is written to either <code>/etc/profile.d/acquire.sh</code> or <code>/etc/profile</code>.
</p><p>
Note that these environment variables will not be set after completion of the install script.
</p><p>The shell level of a script is always one deeper than the level
of the shell from where the script is called.
Any environment variable set at this deeper level is lost as soon as
the script terminates, i.e. as soon as control returns to the higher
level.
It is therefore impossible to set environment variables from within a
script (or the script must be sourced, which is not foreseen for <code>install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh</code>).
</p><p>
The solution is to source <code>/etc/profile</code> by hand after the script is done:
</p><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    ./install_mvGenTL_Acquire.sh  /usr/local
    . /etc/profile
</pre></div>
<p>
</p><div style="border: 1px dashed rgb(0, 82, 136); padding: 5px;"> There is space between <code>.</code> and <code>/</code> in the last command.</div>
<p>
The same effect as sourcing <code>/etc/profile</code> can be achieved by logging out and then logging in again, e.g. by restarting X11 (Ctrl-Alt-Delete).
</p><p>
As of the next boot, the environment variables will always be set properly and you can forget about them.
</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="Building_the_Tools_and_Samples"> Building the Tools and Samples </a></h3>
<p>
When it has written all settings to their respective config files, the
script asks the user whether the tools and samples should be built.<br>
If the answer is anything other than <code>n</code>, all tools and samples will be built.<br>
If the answer is <code>n</code> (<em>no</em>), the script will exit without building the tools and samples.<br>
The user can build them at some later point like so:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    cd $HOME/mvimpact-acquire
    make x86
    sudo ldconfig
</pre></div>
The <code>sudo ldconfig</code> must only be run once, after the first make.<br>
It ensures that the applications built in directory <code>$HOME/mvimpact-acquire/apps</code> can find three shared libraries built in <code>$HOME/mvimpact-acquire/lib/x86</code>:
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    libmvDeviceManager.so
    libmvPropHandling.so
</pre></div>

<h3><a name="Optimizing_the_ethernet_connecti"> Optimizing the ethernet connection </a></h3>

<p />
Be sure to set the MTU for the used ethernet port to as high a value as
possible.
<p />
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 9200
</pre></div>
<p />
If this returns
<p />
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    SIOCSIFMTU: Invalid argument
</pre></div>
<p />
the port (here <code>eth0</code>) does not support packets this large
(here <code>9200</code>), and you must try
some lower value. In this case, try a smaller value until no error is
returned.<br>

To see the current MTU for a given port (let's say <code>eth0</code>), type
<p />
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    /sbin/ifconfig eth0
</pre></div>
<p />
Note that the connection is only as fast as the slowest link in the chain,
meaning that in many cases you cannot get anything higher than
<code>1500</code>. In such cases, the network is a limiting factor, and the
camera cannot deliver its optimal performance.<br>
If you cannot use <code>ifconfig</code> with any value higher than
<code>1500</code>, try to rearrange your connection, perhaps by taking out a
slow switch or so.<br>
In addition, be sure to use CAT5E cables.
